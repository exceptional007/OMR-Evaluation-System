## üì¶ Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/exceptional007/OMR-Evaluation-System.git
cd omr-evaluation-system-main
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
- **Python 3.8+ recommended**
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
	- **Windows:**
		```bash
		python -m venv venv
		venv\Scripts\activate
		```
	- **Linux/Mac:**
		```bash
		python3 -m venv venv
		source venv/bin/activate
		```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. (Optional) Install Additional Tools
- For advanced features (e.g., database, OpenCV), check `requirements.txt` and `requirements.dev.txt`.

---

## üö¶ Quick Start

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

- The app will open in your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- For API/backend usage, see the `api/` and `app/` folders.

## üìù Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### 1. Configure Global Settings
- **Theme**: Select your preferred UI theme (Cyberpunk, Synthwave, Light) from the sidebar.
- **Sheet Version**: Choose the OMR sheet version (A/B/C/D) matching your answer sheets.
- **Score Info**: View per-subject and total maximum scores.

### 2. Upload Answer Key
- Click **Upload Answer Key (.xlsx)** and select your answer key Excel file.
- If your file has multiple sheets (sets), select the correct one from the dropdown.
- The app will parse and load the answer key, showing a success message.

### 3. (Optional) Template & Alignment
- Expand the **Template & Alignment** section.
- Upload a custom template JSON for non-standard OMR layouts.
- Adjust alignment parameters:
	- **Fill Threshold**: Sensitivity for filled bubbles.
	- **Min Margin**: Minimum difference between top two choices.
	- **Scale X/Y**: Fine-tune horizontal/vertical scaling.
	- **Offset X/Y**: Shift the grid for perfect alignment.
	- **Show Debug Overlay**: Visualize detection overlays on images.

### 4. Upload OMR Sheets
- Click **Select up to 500 images** and upload your scanned OMR answer sheets (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`).
- The app will queue and display the number of images uploaded.

### 5. Set Options & Run Evaluation
- **Large Batch Mode**: Enable for 200+ images to speed up processing (skips per-image sheets in export).
- **Save to Database**: Optionally store results in your database (configure in `app/core/config.py`).
- **Student ID Pattern**: Set how student IDs are extracted (e.g., from filename).
- Click **Evaluate** to start processing.

### 6. Monitor Progress
- A progress bar and live status metrics will show evaluation progress.
- Errors (if any) are reported per file.

### 7. View & Download Results
- **Summary Tab**: View a table of all results (filename, set, per-subject, total scores).
- **Charts Tab**: Visualize total score distribution and per-subject averages.
- **Downloads Tab**: Export results as Excel (with per-image sheets) or CSV.
